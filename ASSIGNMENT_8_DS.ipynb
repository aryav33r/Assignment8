        "## 1. **Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER  : No, PyInputPlus is **not** part of the Python Standard Library. It is a third-party module that must be installed separately using pip:\n",
        "```bash\n",
        "pip install pyinputplus\n",
        "```\n",
        "PyInputPlus builds upon the standard library's `input()` function but provides enhanced input validation features. While Python's standard library includes basic input capabilities, PyInputPlus offers more robust input handling with validation, retries, and timeouts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. **Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with `import pyinputplus as pypi`?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : PyInputPlus is commonly aliased as `pypi` because:\n",
        "1. The full name \"pyinputplus\" is quite long (11 characters)\n",
        "2. \"pypi\" is short (4 characters) while still being recognizable\n",
        "3. It follows Python convention of using meaningful abbreviations\n",
        "4. It prevents confusion with similarly named modules\n",
        "5. It's easier to type repeatedly in code\n",
        "\n",
        "Example usage:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "import pyinputplus as pypi\n",
        "age = pypi.inputInt(\"Enter your age: \")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. **How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The key differences are:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Feature        | inputInt()                          | inputFloat()                        |\n",
        "|----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n",

        "| Validation     | Rejects decimal points              | Accepts decimal points              |\n",
        "| Conversion     | int() conversion                    | float() conversion                  |\n",

        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Will accept 7 but reject 7.5\n",
        "num = pypi.inputInt(\"Enter whole number: \")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Will accept both 7 and 7.5\n",
        "num = pypi.inputFloat(\"Enter any number: \")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. **Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : Use `inputInt()` with `min` and `max` parameters:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "number = pypi.inputInt(\n",
        "    prompt=\"Enter a number (0-99): \",\n",
        "    min=0,\n",
        "    max=99\n",
        ")\n",
        "```\n",
        "This will:\n",
        "1. Only accept integer input\n",
        "2. Reject numbers below 0\n",
        "3. Reject numbers above 99\n",
        "4. Keep prompting until valid input is received\n",
        "5. Show appropriate error messages if invalid input is entered\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. **What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : These parameters accept lists of regular expression strings:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `allowRegexes`: List of regex patterns that **valid** inputs must match\n",
        "- `blockRegexes`: List of regex patterns that **invalid** inputs must not match\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Only allow input starting with 'A' or 'B'\n",
        "name = pypi.inputStr(\n",
        "    \"Enter name (must start with A/B): \",\n",
        "    allowRegexes=[r'^[AB]']\n",
        ")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Block any input containing numbers\n",
        "text = pypi.inputStr(\n",
        "    \"Enter text (no numbers allowed): \",\n",

        "## 6. **If a blank input is entered three times, what does `inputStr(limit=3)` do?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : When `limit=3` is set and blank input is entered three times:\n",
        "1. After the first blank input: Prompts again\n",
        "2. After the second blank input: Prompts again\n",
        "3. After the third blank input: Raises a `RetryLimitException` and stops execution\n",
        "\n",
        "This prevents infinite loops from blank inputs while giving users a few chances to enter valid data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. **If blank input is entered three times, what does `inputStr(limit=3, default='hello')` do?**\n",
        "\n",
        "ANSWER : When both `limit=3` and `default='hello'` are set:\n",
        "1. After three blank inputs (reaching the limit)\n",
        "2. Instead of raising an exception, the function:\n",
        "   - Returns the default value 'hello'\n",
        "   - Continues program execution\n",
        "   - No exception is raised\n",
        "\n",
        "This provides a graceful fallback when users don't provide input. Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "name = pypi.inputStr(\n",
        "    \"Enter your name (optional): \",\n",
        "    limit=3,\n",
        "    default='Anonymous'\n",
        ")\n",
